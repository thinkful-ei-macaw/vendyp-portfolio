                    <p>My name is Vendy Prum and I am an aspiring Web/Software Developer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p> 
                        <p>Iâ€™m not afraid of taking on new challenges and am striving for a brighter future, where I am met with new things to learn everyday. I am ecstatic to pursue new opportunities and gain different skill sets to help me face the world. I look forward to working with passionate programmer teammates where we can share our knowledge and succeed.</p>
                        
                    <p>Programming is something I have always wished I delved more into as it is fascinating what people can build. I too, want the chance to build my imagination.</p> 
                   <p>
                    My background is in Electrical Engineering and I have worked as a Quality Engineer at fitbit for over 3 years on their class II medical devices. I was the lead failure analysis engineer on the medical devices and helped ensure the products were in compliance with ISO and FDA regulations.
