              My name is Vendy Prum and I am an aspiring Web/Software Developer
              based in the San Francisco Bay Area.
            </p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m not afraid of taking on new challenges and am striving for a
              brighter future, where I am met with new things to learn everyday.
              I am ecstatic to pursue new opportunities and gain different skill
              sets to help me face the world. I look forward to working with
              passionate programmer teammates where we can share our knowledge
              and succeed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Programming is something I have always wished I delved more into
              as it is fascinating what people can build. I too, want the chance
              to build my imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
              My background is in Electrical Engineering and I have worked as a
              Quality Engineer at fitbit for over 3 years on their class II
              medical devices. I was the lead failure analysis engineer on the
              medical devices and helped ensure the products were in compliance
              with ISO and FDA regulations.
            </p>
            <p>
              My day to day hobbies include going to the gym, bullet journaling,
              baking, and traveling the world!
